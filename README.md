## Understanding Machine Data
Industrial machines generate time-series sensor data such as temperature, pressure, vibration, and load.
Machine failures rarely occur suddenly; instead, they are preceded by gradual degradation and abnormal patterns over time.
This project focuses on learning normal behavior and detecting early deviations before breakdown occurs.
